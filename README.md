# PS3-PARAM.PFD-Tool-PS3-Savegame-Tool-
This script can open and decrypt PS3 savegame files protected by a PARAM.PFD. Furthermore it can re-encrypt modified files and integrate the modifications to the PARAM.PFD (signing). It was meant to be used for (Demons Souls) savegame files but may work for other situations as well.
